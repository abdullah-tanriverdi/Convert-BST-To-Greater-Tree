# BST Value Update

This program demonstrates how to update the values of nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) by adding the sum of all greater values in the BST.

## Description

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), this program converts it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in the BST.



## Example

For example, given the following BST:

          5
        /   \
       /     \
      2       8
     / \     / \
    1   3   9   10
               / \
              12  15
             /
            13
